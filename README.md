# Bookmark Manager

This bookmark manager project will be written with the following user stories in mind:

```
As a user
So that I can recall interesting websites
I would like to see a list of stored links

As a user
So that I can revisit websites I find
I would like to add new links

As a user
So that I can group similar websites
I would like to add a tag to a link

As a user
So that I can see similar websites
I would like to filter my bookmarks by tag
```

<!-- Tag:   <% bm.tags.each { |this_tag| %> <%= this_tag.tag %> <% } %> -->
<!-- Tag:   <% bm.tags.first%> <%=.tag %> -->
